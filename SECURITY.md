Gabzology Website Security & Privacy Policy
This Security and Privacy Policy outlines how your information is handled when you visit and interact with the Gabzology website, hosted on GitHub Pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a secure online experience.

1. Data Collection
Our Gabzology website, as provided in the index.html file, is primarily a static informational site. This means it does not directly collect, store, or process any personal data from visitors through the website itself.

However, please note:

Third-Party Services for Orders/Bookings: Any order forms, booking requests, or contact submissions you complete on this website (as indicated in the "Contact" section, which would typically embed a Google Form or similar service) will be handled by those respective third-party platforms (e.g., Google Forms and Google Sheets). We advise you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for details on their data collection, usage, and storage practices.

Website Analytics (Not Currently Implemented): This specific HTML code does not include any direct website analytics (like Google Analytics). If such services were to be added in the future, this policy would be updated to reflect their data collection practices.

2. Information We Do Not Collect Directly
We do not directly collect:

Personal identifying information (e.g., names, email addresses, phone numbers)

Location data

IP addresses

Browsing behavior beyond basic server logs (which are managed by the hosting provider, GitHub Pages, and not directly by Gabzology)

3. Data Usage
Since we do not directly collect personal data on this static website, we do not use your data for any direct purposes.

Information submitted through embedded third-party forms (e.g., Google Forms for orders) would be used solely for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g., fulfilling your order, responding to your inquiry, managing your booking).

4. Data Storage
No personal data is stored on the Gabzology website's server directly. Any data submitted via embedded third-party forms (like Google Forms) is stored securely on those respective platforms, adhering to their security standards.

5. Third-Party Services
This website utilizes the following third-party services:

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Used for styling the website. No data collection from visitors.

Google Fonts: Used for custom typography. Google's privacy policy applies to font serving.

Placeholder Images (During Development): Used for visual representation. No data collection.

Google Forms (Anticipated for Contact/Orders): If you use any embedded forms on this site, your data will be submitted to and processed by Google Forms and Google Sheets. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle data.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third-party websites or services linked from our site.

6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
This static website, in its current form, does not directly use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect personal information or track user behavior.

Third-party services (like Google Fonts, or an embedded Google Form) may use cookies or similar technologies as part of their service. We recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies for details.

7. Data Security
While our website does not directly handle sensitive user data, we are committed to maintaining the security of our website code and ensuring that any third-party integrations are reputable.

For data submitted through Google Forms, Google employs robust security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest, to protect your data.

8. Your Rights
As we do not directly collect personal information, requests regarding access, correction, or deletion of data should be directed to the relevant third-party service (e.g., Google for data submitted via Google Forms).

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Security and Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or relevant regulations. Any updates will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
